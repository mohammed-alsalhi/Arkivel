## [4.19.0] - 2026-03-16

### Enhancements

- **Navigation overhaul** — restructured sidebar from 5 loose sections into 8 purposeful ones: Browse (core content), Discover (exploration + stats), Community (collab features, collapsed by default), Personal (user account), Tools (utilities + integrations, collapsed by default), Contribute (admin), Admin (admin, collapsed), Categories
- Added previously unreachable pages to sidebar: `/popular`, `/series`, `/leaderboard`, `/stats`, `/discussions`, `/users`, `/mentions`, `/present`, `/features`

### Bug Fixes

- **CI e2e crash: duplicate dynamic segment** — `[revId]` and `[revisionId]` coexisted under `revisions/`, causing Next.js to throw "You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path" at startup; moved restore route into the existing `[revisionId]` subtree and updated all param references

## [4.8.8] - 2026-03-04

## [4.8.4] - 2026-03-04

- Fixed `sitemap.ts` prerender failure with same `force-dynamic` opt-out

## [4.8.3] - 2026-03-04

### CI Fixes

- Fixed `npm ci` failure: added `overrides` in `package.json` to resolve `@auth/core`'s pinned `preact@10.11.3` dep consistently with the root `preact@10.24.3`; regenerated `package-lock.json` from scratch
- Fixed build step in CI: moved `prisma db push` to `vercel.json` `buildCommand` so CI runs `next build` only (no database required); `npm run build` now runs just `next build`

### Bug Fixes

- Both fixes resolve editor crash and `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` cascade error

### Permissions (Fine-grained RBAC)
- Added `src/lib/permissions.ts` with `checkPermission()`, `grantPermission()`, `revokePermission()`, `getUserPermissions()`, `getResourcePermissions()`, and `checkSessionPermission()` helpers
- `checkPermission()` checks explicit `PermissionGrant` rows first, falls back to role-based defaults; admin role always passes all checks

### Theme Builder
- Added `src/app/admin/theme/page.tsx` — client-side visual theme builder at `/admin/theme`

- `summarizeArticle(content)` — strips HTML, limits to 3000 chars, prompts for 2-3 sentence summary
- `suggestRelatedTopics(title, content, existingTags)` — returns up to 5 suggested article topic titles
- `generateContent(prompt, existingContent?)` — generates or continues article content; wraps prompt differently when existing content provided
- All functions check `AI_API_KEY` env var and return null/empty gracefully when not configured
- Added `POST /api/ai` dispatcher for `action: "summarize"|"suggest"|"generate"` (auth required; 501 when AI not configured; 400 for unknown action)
- Added `POST /api/ai/summarize` that fetches an article by ID, enforces visibility, and returns AI summary (auth required)

### Multi-Wiki Support
- Added `GET /api/wikis` listing wikis the user owns or is a member of
- Added `POST /api/wikis` for creating wikis with slug format + uniqueness validation; creator auto-added as admin member via nested create
- Added `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/wikis/[id]` — single wiki with member/article counts; PUT requires wiki admin role; DELETE requires owner
- Added `GET/POST/DELETE /api/wikis/[id]/members` — list members, add (upsert with role), remove members; wiki admin required; owner removal blocked

### Offline Service Worker
- Added `public/sw.js` — vanilla JS service worker with install-time precaching, network-first strategy, and background sync
- Precaches `/`, `/help`, `/search`, and `/offline` on install; activates immediately via `skipWaiting()`
- Caches successful GET responses for `/api/articles/*` and `/articles/*` routes
- Non-GET requests queued in IndexedDB `wiki-sync` → `syncQueue` store when offline; returns 202 Accepted with `queued: true`
- Replays queued mutations on Background Sync `sync` event (`wiki-sync-mutations` tag) or explicit `REPLAY_QUEUE` message
- Shows `/offline` cached HTML page for failed HTML navigation requests
- Added `public/offline.html` — minimal offline page with "You're offline" message, cached-content notice, "Try again" reload button, and footer nav links; respects `prefers-color-scheme` for dark mode

### Contributors API
- Updated `GET /api/users/contributors` to filter only users with at least one published article, return `{ contributors: [...] }` wrapper shape, and include proper try/catch error handling

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-03

API v2 routes with cursor pagination, OAuth/NextAuth stub, Zapier webhooks, and CLI tool.

### New API Routes — v2 (cursor-based pagination)
- Added `GET /api/v2/articles` — cursor-paginated article listing with API key or session auth, field selection via `?fields=`, filters for category/tag/status/search, admin-gated visibility for non-published articles; response shape `{ data, meta: { hasMore, nextCursor, total } }`
- Added `GET /api/v2/articles/:id` — fetch article by id or slug with field selection; includes category, tags, and revision count; non-admins blocked from non-published articles
- Added `GET /api/v2/search` — cursor-paginated, relevance-ranked full-text search; scores: exact title=100, starts-with=80, contains=60, content-only=10; response includes `highlightedExcerpt` and `totalEstimate`
- Added `GET /api/v2/categories` — public hierarchical category tree (recursive build from flat list) with article counts per node, sorted by `sortOrder` at each level
- Added `GET /api/v2/tags` — cursor-paginated tag listing sorted alphabetically with article counts; no auth required
- Cursor format for articles/search: `base64url("<createdAt ISO>|<id>")`, for tags: `base64url("<name>|<id>")`

### OAuth / NextAuth Integration (stub)
- Added `src/lib/oauth.ts` exporting `authOptions` for NextAuth v4 with Google and GitHub providers
- `signIn` callback links OAuth accounts to existing wiki users by email or creates new viewer-role users; stores `OAuthAccount` record with access/refresh tokens
- `session` callback augments the NextAuth session with wiki user `id`, `role`, `username`, and `displayName`
- Generates unique usernames from provider display name with numeric suffix on collision
- Added `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` — NextAuth catch-all handler exporting GET and POST

### Zapier / Make Webhook Integration
- Added `GET /api/webhooks/zapier` — list Zapier subscriptions (Webhook rows with `zapier:`-prefixed events) for the authenticated API key
- Added `POST /api/webhooks/zapier` — subscribe to an event (`article.created`, `article.updated`, `article.deleted`, `article.published`, `comment.created`); body `{ hookUrl, event }`; returns 409 on duplicate
- Added `DELETE /api/webhooks/zapier` — unsubscribe by `hookUrl` (body or query param); returns 404 if no matching subscription
- Added `GET /api/webhooks/zapier/poll` — Zapier polling trigger; returns array of recently created published articles (default last 15 min); returns sample object when empty so Zapier can map fields during setup

### CLI Tool (`cli/`)
- Added `cli/package.json` and `cli/index.js` — standalone ESM CLI using only Node.js 18+ built-ins (no npm dependencies)
- Config stored at `~/.wiki-cli.json` or read from `WIKI_URL` + `WIKI_API_KEY` env vars
- Commands: `config set/show`, `articles list/get/create`, `search`, `export`, `import`, `help`
- `articles list` uses v2 cursor API by default; falls back to v1 page-based when `--page` is passed
- `export` paginates through all articles and writes `.md` (with YAML frontmatter) or `.html` files
- `import` parses YAML frontmatter from Markdown files and POSTs to `/api/articles`
- Pretty-printed aligned tables with ANSI colour (disabled when stdout is not a TTY)

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-02

### New Infrastructure
- Added `StorageProvider` interface in `src/lib/storage.ts` with `upload()`, `delete()`, and `getSignedUrl()` methods
- Implemented `VercelBlobStorage` provider using `@vercel/blob` (default)
- Implemented `S3Storage` provider using `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` for S3/R2/MinIO
- Storage provider selected via `STORAGE_PROVIDER` env var (`"vercel-blob"` or `"s3"`)
- Added Redis caching layer in `src/lib/cache.ts` with `cacheGet()`, `cacheSet()`, `cacheInvalidate()`, and `cacheDel()`
- Redis client is singleton with lazy connect, exponential back-off reconnect, and graceful degradation when `REDIS_URL` is not set
- Cache invalidation uses SCAN-based pattern matching to avoid blocking Redis on large key sets
- Added read replica support in `src/lib/prisma-replica.ts` exporting `prismaRead` PrismaClient
- Replica client uses `DATABASE_REPLICA_URL` env var; falls back to primary when not configured
- Replica client cached on `globalThis` in development to survive hot-reload
